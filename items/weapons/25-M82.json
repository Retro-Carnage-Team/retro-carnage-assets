  "description": "The first prototype of the rifle in 12.7 Ã— 99 mm caliber was built in 1982, which explains the designation M82, and initially only a few were produced for the civilian market. This changed when the Swedish army bought 100 rifles in 1989. A short time later, the US armed forces ordered a larger quantity of M82s in preparation for Operation Desert Storm as a Special Applications Scoped Rifle. The M82 is currently used by over 30 countries.",
