  "description": "The AKS-74U is modeled on the AK-74 carbine. It has the typical dimensions and characteristics of a submachine gun, but fires the powerful 5.45 × 39 mm ammunition of the AK-74. A striking feature is the conical flash hider, which is attached to the end of the barrel instead of a muzzle brake and serves as an intake chamber, which prevents excessive recoil and telltale muzzle flash.",
