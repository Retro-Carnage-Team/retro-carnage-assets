  "description": "A minigun is a fully automatic firearm with a standard caliber of 7.62 × 51 mm that operates on the Gatling principle. Engineers scaled down the 20 mm Gatling gun M61 Vulcan to the NATO standard caliber 7.62 × 51 mm. The result was the six-barrel Minigun. The machine gun could fire 6000 rounds per minute without overheating.",
